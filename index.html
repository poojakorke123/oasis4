            <h2>Jyotirao Govindrao Phule.(11 April 1827 – 28 November 1890)</h2>
            <p>Jyotirao Govindrao Phule was an Indian social activist, businessman, anti-caste social reformer and writer from Maharashtra. 
                His work extended to many fields, including eradication of untouchability and the caste system and for his efforts in 
                educating women and oppressed caste people 


                In India during the nineteenth century, Jyotirao “Jyotiba” Govindrao Phule was a well-known social reformer and thinker. 
                He served as the movement’s leader against India’s widespread caste system. 
                He fought for the rights of peasants and other people from lower castes and revolted against the Brahmins’ rule.
                 According to Phule’s biographer Dhananjay Keer, Vithalrao Krishnaji Vandekar, a fellow reformer from Bombay,
                  gave Phule the title of Mahatma. Throughout his life, Mahatma Jyotiba Phule battled for the education of girls and was a pioneer 
                  for women rights in India. He is credited with founding the first Hindu orphanage for unfortunate children

            <P>
                In 1848, aged 21, Phule visited a girls' school in Ahmednagar run by Christian missionary Cynthia Farrar.It was also in 1848 that he read Thomas Paine's book Rights of Man and developed a keen sense of social justice. 
                 He realized that exploited castes and women were at a disadvantage in Indian society, and also that education of these sections was vital to
                 their emancipation.[24] To this end and in the same year,
                 Phule first taught reading and writing to his wife, Savitribai, and then the couple started the first indigenously run school for girls in
                 PuneConservatives in Pune also forced his own family and community to ostracize them. But he did not stop he tried to teach as much girls as possible.
